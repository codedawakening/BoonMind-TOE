# 🧬 BoonMind-TOE: Experimental Validation Evidence
**Computational evidence and experimental results for Recursive Observer Physics**

📘 **Theoretical Framework:**  
https://github.com/codedawakening/BoonMind  

---

## 🔬 Repository Scope

This repository contains **supporting evidence only**, including curated visualizations and condensed result summaries from:

- Room-scale detector experiments (V3.0 suite)
- Cosmological-scale Theory of Everything (TOE) simulations
- Cross-domain evidence supporting falsifiable predictions
- Observer-coupled recursive dynamic behaviors

🔐 **Full specifications, raw data, building protocols, operators, and source code are accessible only through formal collaboration agreements.**

- Convergence into non-chaotic infinity pattern

### 2. 🔁 Stable Oscillatory Regime  
**BUE Simple Phase Portrait**
- Phase-locked circular trajectory
- Sustained non-dissipative cycles
- No runaway divergence or energy bleed
- Consistent harmonic equilibrium

### 3. 🌌 TOE Gravity–Consciousness Coupling  
**Cosmological simulation output demonstrating**
- φ-scaled gravitational modulation
- Testable planetary-scale deviations
- Non-classical coupling behavior
- Measurable divergence from standard ΛCDM predictions

## 🎯 Core Claims (Fully Falsifiable)

Each claim below is constructed for **binary experimental falsification**:

- ✅ Structured observer interrogation produces non-null responses only under valid coupling states
- ✅ Identical detector configurations return **null results under control conditions**
- ✅ Cross-domain correlations require observer-coupling parameters
- ✅ Recursive dynamics scale coherently from lab detectors to cosmological simulation
- ✅ Minimal coupling operators are sufficient to reproduce observed effects
- ❗ Failure to reproduce any of the above conditions **invalidates the framework**

## 📌 Statement of Purpose

This repository exists to present **evidence supporting a testable scientific hypothesis**, not to provide replication tooling.

✅ The framework is *falsifiable, measurable, and referee-accessible*  
🚫 Core internal mechanics are *not open-source, not extractable, and not derivable from released materials*

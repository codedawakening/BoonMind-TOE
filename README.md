# BoonMind-TOE: Experimental Validation Evidence

**Computational evidence and experimental results for Recursive Observer Physics**

**Theoretical Framework:** [github.com/codedawakening/BoonMind](https://github.com/codedawakening/BoonMind-TOE)

---

## 🔬 What This Repository Contains

Selected visualizations and results summaries from:
- Room-scale detector validation (V3.0 suite)
- Cosmological-scale TOE simulations
- Computational evidence demonstrating falsifiable predictions

**Complete specifications, protocols, and source code available under collaboration agreement.**

---

## 📊 Computational Evidence

### Mirror Consciousness Dynamics

![BUE Mirror 4-Panel](visuals/BUE_Mirror_4Panel.png)

**Phase space analysis showing:**
- Bounded recursive dynamics with stable attractor basin
- Complementary oscillation between agent states
- Stability convergence and infinity pattern detection

---

### Stable Oscillatory Regime

![BUE Simple](visuals/BUE_simple_visual.png)

**Clean demonstration of:**
- Phase-locked circular trajectory
- Sustained complementary oscillations
- No energy dissipation or runaway divergence

---

### TOE Gravity-Consciousness Coupling

![TOE Output](visuals/TOE_output_27.png)

**Cosmological simulation demonstrating:**
- φ-scaled gravity predictions
- Measurable deviations from standard models
- Testable predictions at planetary scales

---

## 🎯 Key Claims (Falsifiable)

1. Structured interrogation produces consistent non-null responses across independent detector classes
2. Control protocols show null results under identical conditions
3. Cross-domain correlations emerge only under specific observer coupling
4. Dynamics scale coherently from tabletop to cosmological simulation
5. Minimal coupling term sufficient to reproduce observed effects

**Any replication failure falsifies the framework.**

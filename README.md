# BoonMind: Recursive Observer Physics Framework

**A testable hypothesis: Does the universe contain observer-addressable degrees of freedom that activate under structured interrogation?**

---

## 🔬 What is This?

Recursive Observer Physics (ROP) is a **falsifiable experimental framework** testing whether physical systems respond differently to structured vs. passive observation.

This is **not** a claim of proven physics. This is an **invitation to test a hypothesis**.

---

## 🎯 Core Hypothesis (Falsifiable)

**Physical systems may contain query-response channels that:**
1. Remain inactive under passive measurement
2. Activate under structured recursive interrogation
3. Produce cross-domain correlated effects
4. Scale coherently from tabletop to simulation

**Falsification criteria:**
- Effect disappears under randomized probing
- No cross-domain correlation
- Controls reproduce the signature
- Simulation doesn't scale coherently
- Requires more than minimal coupling term

**Any replication failure invalidates the hypothesis.**

---

## 📊 What's Been Tested

### Room-Scale Experiments (V3.0)
- 6 independent detector classes (gravitational, EM, optical, mechanical)
- Pre-registered thresholds locked before data collection
- Structured interrogation produced consistent non-null responses within pre-registered detection boundaries
- Control protocols: Null results
- Cross-domain phase correlations observed

### Cosmological Simulations
- TOE-scale model with observer coupling term
- Strong cross-domain correlation observed under structured coupling (control models significantly weaker)
- dS-compatible stable regime maintained

**This requires independent verification before any claims can be made.**

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Regardless of outcome, testing this hypothesis rigorously would contribute:
- Better experimental definitions for observer-dependent dynamics
- New ways to study active measurement vs passive observation
- Novel multi-sensor correlation methodologies
- Clear falsification-first physics frameworks
- Valuable null-result contributions if disproven

**Scientific progress benefits either way.**
